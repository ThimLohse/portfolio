description: In the spring of 2017, I did a stand-alone degree project at the undergraduate level as part of the MSc program at KTH. The purpose of the work was to explore the possibilities of indoor maps for retail and large department stores using bluetooth beacons. The focus was on streamlining the process of finding goods, and getting additional information about these goods. An iOS application was developed with the functions navigation and localization, as well as the ability to scan barcodes for more information about a product and its stock status. The application was tested in small qualitative tests in the form of common scenarios within retail and showed promising results for how this type of technology can enhance the buying process.
