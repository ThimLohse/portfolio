description: asqill is a small Swedish startup that started at KTH Innovation. Their goal is to build a better relationship between students and companies during the students' time at school. This is done by offering work experiences relative to their fields of study. When the number of users grew, a tool was needed to enable an easy way to send informative mail to all their members. In the role of developer I have created an integration between the company's database of users and Mailchimps mail service. Today, the service is used to easily send customized mail campaigns to all users.
