description: Spotify is a Swedish multinational company and one of the largest players to offer a streaming service for music. Each year, a select number of students are invited to use their creativity and technical know-how to create new innovative applications with the Spotify API during a weekend. I worked as a backend developer and together with my group created a music sharing platform online.
