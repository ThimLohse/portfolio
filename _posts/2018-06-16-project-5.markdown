description: The Internet of Things, IoT, is a growing trend in many industries. I have independently developed an application that can be used to control connected products and services in the home with voice commands. During this project I have familiarised myself with both front-end frameworks such as React as well as back-end frameworks with Node.js, Express and MongoDB amongst them.
